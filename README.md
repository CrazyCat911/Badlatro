# Badlatro

Ruining Balatro, one `[anything]` at a time.

## What does this mod do?

This mod is a way to _"improve"_ Balatro - not through gameplay changes, but by changing the text and textures.

## WHY??!?

It's funny.

# Installation

1. Install [lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [steammodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), if you haven't already.
2. Download the source code zip of the [latest release](https://github.com/CrazyCat911/Badlatro/releases/latest)
3. Unzip the folder into your Balatro Mods folder. It should all be in a folder called something like `BADLATRO-0.0.1-ALPHA`.
4. Lauch Balatro, and set the in-game language to "Badlatro English"
